| This setting only takes effect once a biometric has been used to access the app. Depending on the Android device manufacturer, not all forms of biometrics may be supported for cryptographic operations. Currently, cryptographic operations are supported for any biometric (e.g., fingerprint, iris, or face) on the device that meets or exceeds the requirements for Class 3 biometrics, as defined in the Android documentation. See the BIOMETRIC_STRONG constant of the BiometricManager.Authenticators interface and the authenticate method of the BiometricPrompt class.
